                <p>
                    <b>Formula One</b>, commonly abbreviated as <b>F1</b>, is the highest
                    class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater
                    formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération
                    Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The <b>FIA Formula One
                        World Championship</b> has been one of the world's premier
                    forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and
                    is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The
                    word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all
                    participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season
                    consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands
                    Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on
                    either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A point-system is used at Grands Prix to determine two
                    annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one
                    for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver
                    must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing
                    licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade
                    One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for
                    tracks.
                </p>

                    Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated
                    road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds
                    achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic
                    downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear
                    wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on
                    electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction
                    control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other
                    electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They
                    were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently
                    been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.

                    With the average annual cost of running a team—designing,
                    building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at
                    approximately £220 million, Formula One's financial and
                    political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group
                    is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from
                    private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for US$8 billion.

                    Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers'
                    Championship (1925-1930) and European Drivers' Championship
                    (1931-1939). The formula is a set of rules that all
                    participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula
                    agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947.
                    The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations
                    was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's
                    official start.<span class="p-num">[5]</span>
                    <span class="p-num">[6]</span> Before World War II, a
                    number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions
                    for a new championship to replace the European Championship,
                    but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the
                    new International Formula for cars did not become formalised
                    until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World
                    Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.
                    <span class="p-num">[7]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand
                    Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United
                    Kingdom on 13 May 1950.<span class="p-num">[8]</span>
                    Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship,
                    narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio
                    won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957.<span class="p-num">[9]</span>
                    This set the record for the most World Championships won by
                    a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until
                    Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.<span class="p-num">[9]</span>

                            A Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958
                            season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded
                            as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the
                            1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One
                            championship.<span class="p-num">[10]</span> Between 1955 and 1961, Moss
                            finished second in the championship four times and
                            third the other three times.<span class="p-num">[11]</span><span class="p-num">[12]</span>
                            Fangio won 24
                            of the 52 races he entered—still the record for the
                            highest Formula One winning percentage by an
                            individual driver.<span class="p-num">[13]</span> National championships
                            existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s
                            and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula
                            One events for many years. Due to the increasing
                            cost of competition, the last of these was held in
                            1983.<span class="p-num">[14]</span><span class="p-num">[15]</span>

                    This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers,
                    such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati.
                    The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's
                    158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and
                    1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated
                    engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two
                    regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to
                    concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars.<span class="p-num">[16]</span><span
                        class="p-num">[17]</span> When
                    a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres
                    was reinstated for the 1954 world championship,
                    Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things
                    never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic
                    valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork.
                    Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two
                    years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport
                    competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.<span class="p-num">[18]</span><span

                            A Formula One constructor is the entity credited for
                            designing the chassis and the engine.<span class="p-num">[114]</span> If both
                            are designed by the same company, that company

                            (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different
                            companies, both are credited, and the name of the
                            chassis designer is placed before that of the engine
                            designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors
                            are scored individually, even if they share either
                            chassis or engine with another constructor
                            (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983).<span class="p-num">[115]</span>

                <p>
                    Since 1981,<span class="p-num">[116]</span> Formula One teams have been required to
                    build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently
                    the distinction between the terms "team" and "constructor"
                    became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced
                    by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the
                    sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows
                    teams to purchase chassis, and "spec series" such as Formula
                    2 which require all cars be kept to an identical
                    specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers,
                    which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.

                    The sport's debut season, 1950, saw eighteen teams compete,
                    but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact,
                    such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the
                    first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were
                    admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula
                    One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.

                            Early manufacturer involvement came in the form of a
                            "factory team" or "works team" (that is, one owned
                            and staffed by a major car company), such as those
                            of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds
                            the record for having won the most Constructors'
                            Championships (sixteen).

                            Companies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart,
                            Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team
                            affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could
                            not afford to manufacture them. In the early years,
                            independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also
                            built their engines, though this became less common
                            with the increased involvement of major car
                            manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda,
                            Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large
                            budgets rendered privately built engines less
                            competitive. Cosworth was the last independent
                            engine supplier.<span class="p-num">[117]</span> It is estimated the major
                            teams spend between €100 and €200 million
                            ($125-$225 million) per year per manufacturer on
                            engines alone.<span class="p-num">[118]</span>

                        <p>
                            In the 2007 season, for the first time since the
                            1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other
                            teams. Super Aguri started the season using a
                            modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda
                            the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used
                            the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing
                            team, which was formally designed by a separate
                            subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended
                            for 2010 with the publication of new technical
                            regulations, which require each constructor to own
                            the intellectual property rights to their chassis,
                            <span class="p-num">[119]</span><span class="p-num">[120]</span> The regulations continue to
                            allow a team
                            to subcontract the design and construction of the
                            chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT
                            team in 2010 and Haas currently.

                    in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four
                    drivers in a season.<span class="p-num">[85]</span> A team may also run two additional
                    drivers in Free Practice sessions,<span class="p-num">[85]</span> which are often used
                    to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One
                    driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most
                    drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a
                    season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons,
                    in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on
                    an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be
                    in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a
                    Grand Prix,<span class="p-num">[127]</span> which is issued to drivers who have met the
                    criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and
                    having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a
                    Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence
                    by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the
                    criteria.<span class="p-num">[127]</span> Although most drivers earn their seat on
                    ability, commercial considerations also come into play with
                    teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Teams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for
                    regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car;
                    although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers'
                    role mainly takes places on a simulator,<span class="p-num">[128]</span> such as
                    rFactor Pro,<span class="p-num">[129]</span><span class="p-num">[130]</span> which is used by most
                    of the F1
                    teams.<span class="p-num">[131]</span><span class="p-num">[132]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99
                    (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules
                    Bianchi)<span class="p-num">[133]</span> upon entering Formula One and keeps that
                    number during their time in the series. The number one is
                    reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains
                    their previous number and may choose to use it instead of
                    the number one.<span class="p-num">[134]</span> At the onset of the championship,
                    numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc
                    basis from race to race.<span class="p-num">[135]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Permanent numbers were introduced in 1973 to take effect in
                    1974, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order
                    based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the
                    end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers
                    from season to season with the exception of the team with
                    the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers
                    with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New
                    entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception
                    of the number 13 which had been unused since 1976.<span class="p-num">[136]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car
                    numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27
                    and 28.<span class="p-num">[135]</span> A different system was used from 1996 to 2013:
                    at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion
                    was designated number one, their teammate number two, and
                    the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according
                    to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.<span class="p-num">[137]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of 2024, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the
                    World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and
                    Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships
                    with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too,
                    in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion,
                    after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal
                    accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still
                    remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom
                    have been the most successful in the sport, with 20
                    championships among 10 drivers, and 316 wins.<span class="p-num">[138]</span>

                <p>
                    Formula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for
                    tracks.<span class="p-num">[184]</span> The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary
                    significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a
                    clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run
                    anticlockwise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with
                    the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where
                    cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change
                    their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race
                    (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated
                    mid-race refueling of the cars.<span class="p-num">[185]</span> Special pit roads and track markings
                    help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.

                <p>
                    Most of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar
                    also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks
                    include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion
                    Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as "like riding a bicycle around your living
                    room".<span class="p-num">[186]</span> The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's
                    minimum race distance requirement—the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance
                    of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.<span class="p-num">[187]</span><span

                    Circuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as
                    exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in 2004 and designed – like most of F1's new
                    circuits – by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke,
                    have been criticised as lacking the "flow" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola.<span
                        class="p-num">[189]</span> His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while
                    providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has
                    been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the
                    long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally
                    agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.<span
                        class="p-num">[190]</span>

                    The Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in
                    Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International
                    Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country
                    having last hosted a race in 1996.<span class="p-num">[b]</span> In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned
                    to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985.<span

                <p>
                    Modern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters. The
                    chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and
                    strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 795 kg (1,753 lb) – the
                    minimum weight set by the regulations.<span class="p-num">[193]</span> If the construction of the
                    car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams
                    take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby
                    locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight
                    transfer.<span class="p-num">[194]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they
                    generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by "wings" mounted at the front
                    and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of
                    the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The
                    previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, "barge boards", and turning
                    vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From
                    1998 to 2008, the tyres in Formula One were not "slicks" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most
                    other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its
                    surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.<span class="p-num">[195]</span> Slick
                    tyres returned to Formula One in the 2009 season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front
                    and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the
                    2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first
                    car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and
                    rear in their 2012 car.<span class="p-num">[196]</span> Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of
                    the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In 2022, McLaren (MCL36)
                    and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.<span
                        class="p-num">[197]</span><span class="p-num">[198]</span>

                <p>
                    Carbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These
                    provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the
                    greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon<span class="p-num">[199]</span>
                    material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance<span class="p-num">[200]</span>
                    under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for
                    maximum performance and cooling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2022, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly
                    referred to as "dirty air") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned
                    front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the
                    banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have
                    been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It
                    allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the
                    turbulent air.<span class="p-num">[201]</span> (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical

                    Formula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two
                    magnesium alloys specified by the FIA.<span class="p-num">[202]</span> Magnesium alloy wheels made
                    by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction.<span
                        class="p-num">[203]</span> As of 2022, the wheels are covered with "spec" (Standardised) Wheel
                    Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the "tyre profile"),
                    and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.<span class="p-num">[204]</span>

                <p>
                    Starting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally
                    aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.<span class="p-num">[205]</span> These get a
                    significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy
                    recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol.<span
                        class="p-num">[206]</span> The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is
                    very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and
                    produced over 580 kW (780 bhp).<span class="p-num">[207]</span> For 2007, engines were restricted to
                    19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since
                    the end of 2006.<span class="p-num">[208]</span> For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were
                    further restricted to 18,000 rpm.<span class="p-num">[209]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A wide variety of technologies – including active suspension<span class="p-num">[210]</span> are
                    banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds
                    in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits.<span class="p-num">[211]</span> The highest
                    straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by Juan Pablo
                    Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix.<span class="p-num">[212]</span> During qualifying for
                    the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph).<span
                        class="p-num">[213]</span> A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a
                    runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda,
                    the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.<span class="p-num">[214]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce
                    is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough
                    downforce to "drive on the ceiling", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test.
                    Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the
                    cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity
                    (3.5g) in cornering.<span class="p-num">[215]</span> Consequently, the driver's head is pulled
                    sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are
                    enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to
                    maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance
                    road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.<span class="p-num">[216]</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of 2019, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time.<span
                        class="p-num">[217]</span> Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship

                    the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where
                    the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season,
                    in which case up to five may be used by a driver.<span class="p-num">[218]</span> Each driver may
                    use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events; every unscheduled gearbox change requires
                    the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to
                    reasons beyond the team's control.<span class="p-num">[219]</span>

                <p>
                    As of 2019, each driver is limited to three power units per season, before incurring grid penalties.

                    Formula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts
                    one of the largest global television audiences. The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600
                    million people per race.<span class="p-num">[264]</span> The cumulative television audience was
                    calculated to be 54 billion for the 2001 season, broadcast to 200 territories.<span

                    During the early 1990s, Formula One Group created a number of trademarks, an official logo, an
                    official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it
                    a corporate identity.

                    TV stations all take what is known as the "World Feed", either produced historically by the "host
                    broadcaster" or by Formula One Management (FOM). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all,
                    or two separate feeds – a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size
                    fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led
                    to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant
                    that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the
                    local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.

                <p>
                    The only station that differed from this set up was "DF1" (re-branded to "Premiere" then to "Sky
                    Deutschland") – a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such
                    as the onboard and pit-lane channels. This service was purchased by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of
                    1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of
                    2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much.

                    On 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.<span

                    It was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1
                    from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live
                    without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1
                    programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows.<span
                        class="p-num">[267]</span> In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the
                    season.<span class="p-num">[268]</span> The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season,
                    three years earlier than planned.<span class="p-num">[269]</span> The free-to-air TV rights were
                    picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season.<span class="p-num">[270]</span> Sky Sports
                    F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until
                    2021.<span class="p-num">[271]</span> As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to
                    such coverage until 2024.<span class="p-num">[272]</span>

                    While Sky Sports and Channel 4 are the two major broadcasters of Formula 1, other countries show
                    Formula One races. Many use commentary from either Sky Sports or Channel 4. In most of Asia
                    (excluding China), the two main broadcasters of Formula One includes the Fox network and Star Sports
                    (in India). In the United States, ESPN holds the official rights to broadcast the sport while ABC
                    also holds free-to-air rights for some races under the ESPN on ABC banner. In Germany, Austria and
                    Switzerland, the two main broadcasters are RTL Germany and n-TV. In China, there are multiple
                    channels that broadcast Formula One which include CCTV, Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.<span
                        class="p-num">[273]</span> Currently in France, the only channel that broadcasts Formula One is
                    the pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.<span

                    The official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow
                    the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store
                    since 2009,<span class="p-num">[275]</span> and on Google Play since 2011,<span
                        class="p-num">[276]</span> that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and
                    commentary.<span class="p-num">[277]</span> On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo,
                    which replaced the previous "flying one" in use since 1993.<span class="p-num">[278]</span>

                    In March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets
                    viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional
                    directed race footage and commentary.<span class="p-num">[279]</span> In April 2024, FOM launched a
                    free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States,
                    which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.<span
