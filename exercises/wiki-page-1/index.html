            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>, 
            <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i> <sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed
            in some tree species, in which the crowns of full stocked trees do 
            not touch each other, forming a canopy with change-like gaps.
            <sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among
            trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of 
            different species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> There exist many 
            hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and
            research suggest that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect
            larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.
            <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple
            mechanisms across difference species, and example of convergent
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
