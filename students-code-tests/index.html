                <p>
                    The WWE Royal Rumble is coming in hot and there’s hope for 
                    a lot of surprises. Fans want to see the women’s rumble, 
                    because there’s opportunity for several big names to return 
                    to the show. Speculation is that Charlotte Flair is one of 
                    those performers. That speculation also predicts that she’s 
                    going right back to the top of the women’s division with c
                    hampionship gold around her waist. If Flair does return, 
                    one must wonder where she stands and is best used on the 
                    main roster today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte Flair is a star. In all aspects of professional 
                    wrestling, Flair is a star. It does not matter what 
                    promotion she’d be in; she would still be booked as a top 
                    name in the women’s division. WWE has long positioned her 
                    at the top of the women’s division, even if that meant 
                    lowering other fan favorites along the way. So, no one 
                    should be surprised if someone’s momentum is cut because of 
                    Flair’s return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fightful Select recently reported that a WrestleMania 
                    match in sight pits Flair against new WWE Women’s 
                    Champion, Tiffany Stratton. While Stratton versus Flair 
                    has the allure of a main event contest, WWE must be 
                    careful with the outcome. Think back to when Asuka 
                    moved to the main roster after dominating WWE NXT. 
                    She’d win the Royal Rumble and face Flair at 
                    WrestleMania, only to lose. Some will argue that she 
                    never fully regained her momentum after that moment. 
                    While WWE’s booking at the time is to blame, the company 
                    does not want to make that same mistake with another 
                    young talent in Tiffany Stratton.

                    The WWE Royal Rumble is only a few days away. Fans are 
                    speculating about what will happen, as it seems like the 
                    events are harder to predict than normal. The men's rumble 
                    feels especially big this year, as several of the top names
                    are announced for the match. One such individual is Roman 
                    Reigns. His inclusion in the battle royal makes everything 
                    even more important this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Saturday, February 1, Roman Reigns will enter the Royal 
                    Rumble for the first time in five years. The last time he 
                    stepped into the match, he was the final person eliminated. 
                    Drew McIntyre tossed him over the ropes in a step to set up 
                    his run to the WWE Championship. But it was Reigns who has 
                    been the dominating force since, and the most important 
                    person on the WWE roster.
                </p>
                <h3></h3>
                <p>
                    Now, he doesn't have the WWE Undisputed Championship and 
                    he's on a quest to win it back. Should he be the favorite 
                    for the match? Depends on how you look at the rest of the 
                    field and the stories WWE is telling. But Reigns is 
                    certainly going to have several big moments on Saturday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every interaction that Reigns has in this match has the 
                    potential to lead to something big. Will he and CM Punk 
                    have a face-off moment? Who does Reigns eliminate and will 
                    they turn their focus to him? Who eliminates Reigns and 
                    gets the big momentum boost from that moment? Does he have 
                    a moment with a surprise entrant like Joe Hendry or Josh 
                    Alexander? WWE Creative have done such a great job building 
                    this Royal Rumble as a moment in which so many different 
                    things can happen, there is no way to predict how things 
                    will go down.

                    The Free Agency race of 2025 has started. On January 27 
                    Fightful Select reported WWE snatched the first major name 
                    off the board. Former TNA Knockouts Champion, Jordynne Grace 
                    is officially signed to the biggest wrestling promotion in 
                    the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Sean Ross Sapp, Grace has signed a multi-year 
                    contract. This was one of the worst-kept secrets in the 
                    business, as Grace had made multiple appearances in WWE 
                    during the partnership with TNA Wrestling. According to the 
                    report “WWE made the offer a couple of weeks before Grace 
                    finished up.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grace is a huge signing for the WWE women’s division and 
                    she comes at the perfect time. The 2025 WWE Royal Rumble is 
                    a few short days away, and the women’s division needs a big 
                    name to light a fire in the group. There are reports that 
                    Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair are both poised for a 
                    return, and it would be interesting to see Grace make her 
                    return to the company the same night. There’s also a chance 
                    she will return to WWE NXT, as there are several names there 
                    who she could have great matches and feuds with. But many 
                    believe that Grace is main roster ready, and her successful 
                    14-year career proves that point.

                    will fit perfectly in the WWE. Their feud wasn't for the 
                    title or some great return. The show was excellent and had 
                    those moments, too. Both men felt like stars; their aura, 
                    while opposite, sucked the energy from the fans in 
                    attendance and sent it scattered throughout the Curtis 
                    Culwell Center. It was a magnetic connection they both 
                    forged in their roles. Santana to WWE needs more time to 
                    materialize, but it was Josh Alexander who quit in the match
                    and it seems the company. So, what exactly does he bring 
                    to the WWE Universe?
